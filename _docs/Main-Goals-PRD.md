# Main Goals of the Base Power Site Survey Tool

## Overview
The Base Power Site Survey Tool, also referred to as Gauntlet AI in the PRD, is a mobile web application that leverages Augmented Reality (AR) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to revolutionize home energy site surveys. Developed for Base Power Company, it enables homeowners to perform self-guided, accurate assessments of their homes for energy storage installations, such as batteries. By eliminating the need for in-person professional surveys, the tool aims to make the process faster, more cost-effective, and accessible, ultimately facilitating the adoption of home energy solutions.

## Detailed Problem Statement
Traditional home energy site surveys are plagued by several inefficiencies that hinder scalability and user experience:

- **Manual and Time-Intensive Processes**: Surveys typically require a trained technician to visit the home, take measurements, inspect electrical panels, and assess suitability for installations like batteries or solar panels. This can take hours per visit and involves scheduling challenges, often leading to delays of weeks or months.
- **High Costs and Resource Demands**: Each survey incurs significant labor and travel costs for energy companies. For a company like Base Power, which aims to deploy thousands of home batteries, this model is not scalable without a large field team.
- **Error-Prone Assessments**: Human surveyors may miss details or make measurement errors, leading to incorrect quotes, installation issues, or safety risks. Inconsistent data collection can also complicate backend processing.
- **Accessibility Barriers for Homeowners**: Rural or remote homeowners face longer wait times for surveyor availability. Additionally, privacy concerns arise from having strangers enter homes, and the process can be disruptive to daily life.
- **Data and Integration Challenges**: Manual surveys often result in unstructured data (e.g., handwritten notes, disparate photos), making it hard to integrate with CRM systems or generate automated quotes. This slows down the overall sales and installation pipeline.

The project seeks to solve these by creating a user-friendly mobile web app that empowers homeowners to conduct surveys themselves using their smartphones, with AR guiding measurements and AI analyzing data in real-time. This democratizes access to energy solutions, reduces costs, improves accuracy, and accelerates deployment for companies like Base Power.

## Key Problems It Solves
- **Time-Consuming Manual Surveys**: Replaces professional visits with quick, self-service sessions that users can complete in minutes.
- **Error-Prone Assessments**: AR provides precise, guided measurements, while AI detects issues like incompatible wiring or space constraints automatically.
- **Accessibility Issues**: No scheduling needed; users can survey at their convenience, ideal for remote locations or busy households.
- **Scalability for Energy Companies**: Enables Base Power to handle high volumes of surveys without proportional increases in field staff, integrating seamlessly with backend systems for efficient processing.
- **Privacy and Convenience**: Users control the process, reducing the need for home intrusions while ensuring data security.

## Main Requirements for the Mobile Web App
- **AR Integration**: Utilize device cameras for AR overlays that guide users in measuring spaces, electrical panels, and potential installation sites. Features include virtual rulers, object detection, and real-time feedback.
- **AI Analysis**: Implement AI models to process captured images and videos, identifying suitability factors such as panel compatibility, structural integrity, and hazards. Provide instant reports with recommendations or flags for professional review.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Design an intuitive, responsive mobile web app with step-by-step guidance, progress tracking, and minimal technical requirements (e.g., works on modern smartphones without app installation).
- **Data Collection and Reporting**: Capture photos, videos, measurements, and user notes; generate comprehensive PDF reports or dashboards for users and Base Power teams.
- **Security and Privacy**: Incorporate data encryption, user consent for data usage, and compliance with privacy regulations (e.g., GDPR). Allow users to delete data and ensure secure transmission to servers.
- **Offline Capabilities**: Support core survey functions offline, with automatic syncing when connectivity is restored, to handle areas with poor internet.
- **Integration with Base Power Systems**: Connect to Base Power's CRM and quoting systems for automated lead generation, quote creation, and installation planning based on survey data.
- **User Support and Feedback**: Include tutorials, help sections, and feedback mechanisms to improve user experience and app accuracy over time.

This app not only addresses current pain points in home energy assessments but also positions Base Power as an innovator in sustainable energy solutions, potentially expanding to other use cases like solar installations or EV charging setups.
