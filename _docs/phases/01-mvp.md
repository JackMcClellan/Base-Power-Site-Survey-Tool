4. **AR Framework**: Extensible AR overlay system with multiple overlay types
5. **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface with safe area support
6. **TypeScript Integration**: Full type safety throughout the application

### ðŸ”„ What's In Progress
1. **Survey Flow Architecture**: Foundation is ready, needs survey step implementation
2. **Data Management**: State atoms are in place, needs survey data persistence

###  What's Missing
1. **AI/ML Models**: No TensorFlow.js or object detection yet
2. **Survey Steps**: No actual survey flow or step navigation
3. **Data Capture**: No image capture or data export functionality
4. **OCR Integration**: No text recognition capabilities
5. **Measurement Tools**: Basic overlay framework exists but no interactive tools

## Revised Success Criteria for MVP
