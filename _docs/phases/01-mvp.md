## Success Criteria for MVP

1. **Core Flow Complete**: User can complete entire survey from welcome to review
2. **Object Detection Works**: Can reliably detect computers and bottles with AR overlays
3. **Text Recognition Functions**: Can extract text from electrical panels or equipment
4. **Basic Measurements**: Can measure simple distances using AR tools
5. **Data Persistence**: Survey data is saved and can be reviewed
6. **Mobile Optimized**: Works smoothly on mobile devices with good UX
7. **Error Resilient**: Handles common failure scenarios gracefully

## Technical Debt to Address in MVP
