# Base Power Site Survey Tool - Development Phases

This folder contains detailed development phases for the Base Power Site Survey Tool (Gauntlet AI). Each phase builds upon the previous one to create a comprehensive AR + AI home energy survey solution.

## Phase Overview

- **[Phase 1: MVP](./01-mvp.md)** - Core functionality and proof of concept
- **[Phase 2: Beta](./02-beta.md)** - Enhanced features and real-world testing
- **[Phase 3: Production](./03-production.md)** - Production-ready features and optimizations
- **[Phase 4: Enterprise](./04-enterprise.md)** - Advanced features and enterprise integration

## Current Status

As of the current codebase, we have completed most of **Phase 1 (MVP)** foundation work, with the basic Next.js application structure, state management, and core utilities in place. The survey framework is functional with basic step progression.

## How to Use This Documentation

Each phase document contains:
- âœ… **Completed Features** - What's already implemented
-  **Pending Features** - What needs to be built
- ðŸ“‹ **Feature Descriptions** - Detailed requirements for each feature
- ðŸŽ¯ **Success Criteria** - How to validate completion

## Development Guidelines

1. **Complete each phase fully** before moving to the next
2. **Test thoroughly** at each phase boundary
3. **Document progress** by checking off completed features
4. **Review user feedback** before advancing phases
5. **Maintain backward compatibility** between phases
