# Base Power Site Survey Tool - Development Phases

## Overview

This project is being developed in four distinct phases, progressing from MVP to full enterprise deployment. Each phase builds upon the previous, adding capabilities while maintaining backward compatibility.

### Phase Timeline
- **Phase 1 (MVP)**: Basic camera capture with simple validation
- **Phase 2 (Beta)**: Computer vision integration and enhanced AR
- **Phase 3 (Production)**: Full feature set with offline support
- **Phase 4 (Enterprise)**: Multi-user, team features, and integrations

### Development Approach
1. **Mobile-First**: Every feature designed for mobile primary use
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Start simple, add complexity
3. **Real User Feedback**: Iterate based on field usage
4. **Performance Focus**: Maintain 60fps on mid-range devices

## Current Status

### Phase 1: MVP (In Progress)

**Target**: Basic functional app for electricity meter capture

**Core Features**:
- **Camera Capture**: Full-screen interface with guide overlay - 80% Complete
- **Simple Validation**: Basic image quality checks - 60% Complete
- **Survey Flow Framework**: Architecture ready, needs step implementation
- **Data Management**: State foundation complete, needs persistence layer

**Next Steps**:
1. Complete meter validation logic
2. Add capture retry mechanism
3. Implement data persistence
4. Create review/submit flow

### Phase 2: Beta (Planning)

**Target**: Enhanced capture with real computer vision

**Planned Features**:
- Real-time meter detection
- OCR for meter readings
- Enhanced AR guidance
- Quality scoring system
- Backend API integration

### Phase 3: Production (Future)

**Target**: Full-featured tool for professional use

**Planned Features**:
- Offline operation
- Report generation
- Multi-step workflows
- Advanced measurements
- Cloud sync

### Phase 4: Enterprise (Future)

**Target**: Team collaboration and enterprise integration

**Planned Features**:
- User management
- Team workflows
- API access
- Custom branding
- Analytics dashboard

## Key Principles

### 1. Incremental Delivery
Each phase delivers a usable product. MVP provides basic capture, Beta adds intelligence, Production adds reliability, Enterprise adds scale.

### 2. User-Centric Design
Every feature validated with real field users. No assumptions about workflow - learn from actual usage patterns.

### 3. Technical Excellence
Clean architecture that scales. No shortcuts that compromise future phases. Performance and reliability from day one.

### 4. Clear Communication
Regular updates on progress. Transparent about limitations. Clear documentation for all audiences.
